      <p>This website <b>**estimates**</b> the profitability of buying hashing power on NiceHash.</p>
      <p>
        Calculations are made using my WIP <a href="https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator/tree/rewrite">nicehash-calculator rewrite</a>
        (which uses <a href="https://whattomine.com/">WhatToMine</a>).
        <b>Fees are currently not accounted for.</b>

      </p>
      <p>To WhatToMine or NiceHash: If you would want me to reduce API requests, stop using your name, or anything like that then make an issue with the links above.</p>
      <p>Yellow coins are the most profitable coin of their algorithm. The ROI column is the column you probably care the most about. (If you put Bitcoin in, you could expect to get this much of your bitcoin out)</p>
