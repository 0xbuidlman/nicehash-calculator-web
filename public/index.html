      <p>This website <b>**estimates**</b> the profitability of buying hashing power on NiceHash.</p>
      <p>
        Calculations are made using my WIP <a href="https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator/tree/rewrite">nicehash-calculator rewrite</a>
        (which uses <a href="https://whattomine.com/">WhatToMine</a>).
        <b>Fees are currently not accounted for.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Report bugs or suggest features by <a href="https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator-web/issues/new">making an issue in this repository.</a></p>
      <p><b>Disclaimer: These results may not be accurate. I am not responsible for any losses that may come as a result of this site.</b></p>

      <p>Yellow coins are the most profitable coin of their algorithm. The ROI column is the column you probably care the most about.</p>
