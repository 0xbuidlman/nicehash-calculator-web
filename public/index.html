      <h1>NiceHash Buyer Profitability Chart</h1>
      <p>This website shows the profitability of buying hashing power on NiceHash.</p>

      <p>
        Calculations are made using my WIP <a href="https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator/tree/rewrite">nicehash-calculator rewrite</a>
        (which uses <a href="https://whattomine.com/">WhatToMine</a>) with the arguments <code>--no-header --json-output [and a lot of coins]</code>.
        The program is still a WIP but I believe it is stable enough.
        <b>Fees are currently not accounted for.</b>
      </p>

      <p>Suggest more coins, features, or bugs by making an issue in the repository linked above. (temporary)</p>

      <p>This site design is hopefully temporary and I know it's ugly.</p>
