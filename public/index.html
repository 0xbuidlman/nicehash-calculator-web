      <p>This website <b>**estimates**</b> the profitability of buying hashing power on NiceHash.</p>
      <p>
        Calculations are made using my WIP <a href="https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator/tree/rewrite">nicehash-calculator rewrite</a>
        (which uses <a href="https://whattomine.com/">WhatToMine</a>).
        <b>Fees are currently not accounted for.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Report bugs or suggest features by <a href="https://github.com/GarboMuffin/nicehash-calculator-web/issues/new">making an issue in this repository.</a></p>
      <p>This site design is hopefully temporary and I know it's ugly.</p>
      <p>The column you're probably most interested in is "% Change"</p>
